# Craps Odds Read me

These calculate odds starting with $100 making $5 bets.  If you double your money its considered a win.  Since I have a few adult beverages I normally need cab money so, I have a $10 go-home limit.  This is considered a loss.  These will run an number of times you want just adjust 'games='.  Below is an explination of each. 

Keep in mind that I am python novice, coming from a perl background. So enjoy.

craps-odds-86.py
This calculates betting either the 8 or 6 on the pass line if the other is played at the pass bet.  

craps-odds-95.py
This is an update to the 86 program above.  It will also bet the 6 if the pass roll is a 5.  It will also bet the 8 if the pass roll is a 9.  

Enjoy
